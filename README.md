# Dotfiles

This is my repository for all things configuration and dotfiles. Leveraging *chezmoi* I can use this repository to autoinstall and setup applications/tools on a new machine under the predefined settings/configuration I want within minutes. 

## What are dotfiles?
Files that are named with the prefix of "." are referred to as dotfiles. These are responsible for the configurations, settings and preferences across the various programs and tools on my computer.
